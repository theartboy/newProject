# newProject
Getting started with using GitHub requires for class will require:
* Setting up [Atom](https://www.atom.io)
* Creating the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com)
* Cloning the repository locally and adding the files and assets
* Pushing the local repo to the remote (online cloud version)

After the project is online, it can be cloned to any machine to continue working with the most current version.

### Command Line Tools
On the MacOS the default command line tool is Terminal. It is installed with the OS. The first time you try to use a git command it may ask for permission to install the command line tools needed for git. After that, it is good to go. There are many tutorials online for using Terminal and git.

On Windows the tool to use is PowerShell. Instructions for use and installation can be found on the [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-PowerShell) documentation page.

Even easier \(in my opinion\) is to use a package add-on in Atom. This brings us to the setting up Atom part.

## Atom Setup
Open the **Atom-Preferences** usually found under the Atom pull-down menu. Then you will be in the Atom Settings document.

### Packages
Select **Install** and then in the **Install Package** field, type in the name of the package you want to install. If the package shows a lot of downloads, that most likely means it is useful and popular.

Then click the **Install** button.

The packages we will be using are:
* atom-beautify
* atom-live-server-plus
* color-picker
* minimap
* open-in-browser
* pigments
* platformio-ide-terminal

After installing the packages, restart Atom. Then they will be available under the packages menu in the correct alphabetical order.

### Themes
Click back on the install button on the left column. Where you searched packages, you will notice to the right is a greyed out button that says Themes. Click it and you can search for custom themes.

The theme I use is **monokai**. Click the **install** button to make it available.

Back in the left column menu click on Themes hutton. Now you need to set the UI Theme to **Atom Dark** and the Syntax Theme to **Monokai** to match the demonstrations in class.
