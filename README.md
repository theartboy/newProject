# newProject
Getting started with using GitHub requires for class will require:
* Setting up [Atom](https://www.atom.io)
* Creating the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com)
* Cloning the repository locally and adding the files and assets
* Pushing the local repo to the remote (online cloud version)

After the project is online, it can be cloned to any machine to continue working with the most current version.
